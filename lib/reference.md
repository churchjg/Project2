STRATEGY

START OF GAME:
    -shuffle
    -deal cards

GAMEPLAY:
    -compare players cards
    -Player with higher value card wins and collects all cards from round
    -Conditional for when they play the same card to create war

WAR:
    -both players play 4 cards(meaning that the least amount of cards a player can have at any time is 4!!!)
    -War is determined by last card, player with higher value last card collects whole pile
        -I hope this doesn't happen but if it does, create conditional for double war

CARD COLLECTION:
    -player with higher value card played in round collects all cards and adds them to their deck at the bottom

DETERMINE WINNER:
    -when a player gets to 52 cards they win. Need to be able to count how many cards each player has
    -make sure to print who won

-Make use of classes as much as possible
-try and find emoticons for the suits of the cards
-operating with Ace high (14)
-If you have time, go back and add CSS and HTML to make the page nicer
    -button to begin game (DOM), keep track of number of each players cards on screen, possibly add avatars?, etc.
