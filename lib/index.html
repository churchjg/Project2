    <h1>Open the console to play the Game of War!</h1>
        <h4>For Mac's (Hold down Cmd + Option + J), for Windows (Hold down Cmd + Shift + J</h4>
    <h2>How to Play</h2>
    <p> Each player will receive 26 cards. Each player will turn up a card at the same time and 
        the player who played the card of the highest value collects all cards.</p>
    <h2>Here's the Catch</h2>
    <p>If the cards are of the same value (i.e. 7 & 7), the players will go to 'War'
    When going to War each player turns three cards face down and one card face up. 
    The player with the higher cards takes both piles. 
    There can be instances of back-to-back Wars if the face up card matches values again. 
    If this happens, the players will just repeat the War process.
    </p>
    <h2>How to Win</h2>
    <p> A player can win 2 different ways. 
        First, if they collect all 52 cards, they are victorius. 
        Second, if an instance of 'War' occurs and one player does not have enough cards to go to War 
        (min. of 4 cards) the other player wins.
